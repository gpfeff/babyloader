## BabyLoader 

--- 

BabyLoader a progress bar for pregnant couples expecting a baby. The progress counter works in real time until the due date.

It also comes in three themes: one for boys, one for girls, and one for couples who'd like to leave it a surprise. 

Here's what you need to do to customize it:

In index.html, link to the correct css page. The other two have been commented out. 

In js/baby.js, all you have to do is estimate the date of conception and enter the estimated due date.
